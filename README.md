Projectile motion with air resistance. This project was one of the first things I wrote in python and a huge learning experience. For this reason there are a multiple scripts which basically accomplish the same thing. Projectile_gui.py which was my first attempt at creating a GUI, projectile_function.py which was my process of understanding python functions and then projectile_class.py which was me getting used to creating classes. I intend to re-write this entire project when I can find the time.
